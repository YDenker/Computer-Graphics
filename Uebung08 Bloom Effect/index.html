        <h1>Uebung08 Bloom Effect</h1>
        <canvas width='512' height='512' id='canvas'></canvas>
        <p>I still cannot render into a texture with FBOs. I can't find the problem :(.<br>
            Press [R] to disable the bloom texture or use [Y] and [X] to increase and decrease the intensity.<br>
            All that is missing is combining this renderoutput with the "standart" render output after a gaussian blur effect.</p>
        <p id="stats">Position [0,0,0]</p>
        <p>Use WASD or Arrow key to move around horizontally and QE or +/- to move up and down.<br>
            Hold the F Key to toggle directional lighting in the scene.<br>
            Additionally use the mouse to look around. (might be disabled)<br>
            LeftClick to display or hide the cursor.<br>
            IMPORTANT NOTE:<br>
            If the window does not show the demo refresh the page.<br>
            There sometimes can be an error where the scripts are loaded in wrong order.
